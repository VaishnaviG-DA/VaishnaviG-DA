**From steel plants to sleek dashboards — I blend data, design, and business sense**

 I’m **Sri Vaishnavi**, a data enthusiast who loves working with **Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau**.
 I have 2+ years’ experience in steel plant operations and a year with **AIESEC** building people and processes.
 I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and telling stories with data.
